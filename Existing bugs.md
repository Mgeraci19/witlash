## UI updates I want to make

1. Before the start of Round 1 (Main Round) writing phase it should have an animation on the host screen. It should say 'Round 1 - Main Round' and then in the description say something quirky about surviving and also mention if you lose 3 straight you will get eliminated.

2. Before the start of Round 2 (Semi-Finals) it should display 'Semi-Finals' and explain that Top 4 fighters compete with special bar battles, no HP damage.

3. Before the start of Round 3 (Final) it should display 'THE FINAL' and explain it's an epic 1v1 showdown with 200 HP and attack type selection (Jab/Haymaker/Flying Kick).

4. The popup of corner men is confusing after round 1. I like that it says a bye but I want to see these people with the bye on the Round 2 Writing Phase Page. They should have the captain larger with the corner men smaller and associated with them. It should be outlined and say 'Round 2 bye' on them as well.

5. At the start of the Final I don't see the corner men avatars at all. Resize the champs to be bigger and make the corner men smaller than them but visible. Under the champs avatar it should say 'supported by [corner men name]'.

6. The current standing on the mobile screen has duplicated text and does not actually display the current standing
